# CAVeTalk

CAVEMAN controller message protocol

## Protocol Structure

| Version | ID     | Length | Payload       | CRC     |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | ------- |
| 1 Byte  | 1 Byte | 1 Byte | 0 - 255 Bytes | 4 Bytes |

1. Version refers to the communication version that packet adheres to, starting from V1 represented as 0x01
2. ID refers to the specific message being sent by the packet. Here is a list of the currently supported messages.

| ID   | Name            | Descriptor                                                             |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x01 | Ooga            | CAVeTalk Ping Message, should receive "Booga" back from the controller |
| 0x02 | Movement        | Describes the Speed [m/s] & Turn Rate of the Rover [rad/s]             |
| 0x03 | Camera Movement | Describes the Camera Pan [radians] and Tilt Servo Angles [radians]     |
| 0x04 | Lights          | Toggles the Onboard Headlights                                         |
| 0x05 | Mode            | Switches between Manual Driving Mode and Autonomous Driving Mode       |
| 0x06 | Odometry        | Describes the 3 relative acceleration axes [m/s^2], 3 gyroscopic axes [rad/s], and 4 encoder values for each wheel [rad/s] |
| 0x07 | Logging         | Send String Messages Between Devices |

3. Length refers to the length of the packet in bytes
4. Payload refers to the main piece of information sent in the packet

## Protobufs

[Protobufs](https://protobuf.dev/) are Googleâ€™s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. In this project, they are used to serialize message payloads.

### C/Embedded

When building the C version of this library and/or using this library on an embedded system, follow these steps to setup Protobufs:

1. Initialize and update submodules

   `git submodule update --init --recursive `

   - Use this command to see the progress of each submodule pull

      `git submodule update --init --recursive --progress`

2. Make the script to generate the Protobuf payloads for C with `nanopb` executable.

   `chmod +x tools/nanopb/generate.sh`

3. Run the `generate` script to generate the Protobuf payloads for C with `nanopb`.  This step requires Python3 to be installed.

    `./tools/nanopb/generate.sh`

### C++

When building the C++ version of this library, follow these steps to setup Protobufs:

1. Initialize and update submodules

   `git submodule update --init --recursive`

   - Use this command to see the progress of each submodule pull

      `git submodule update --init --recursive --progress`

2. Navigate to the `protobuf` directory

   `cd external/protobuf`

3. Configure CMake build

   `cmake -S . -B _build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_build/protobuf-install -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DABSL_PROPAGATE_CXX_STD=ON`

4. Build `protobufs`

   `cmake --build _build --config Release`

5. Install `protobufs` in `external/protobufs/_build/protobuf-install`

   `cmake --build _build -t install`

## Build

Prerequisites
- CMake >= 3.30
- Ninja
- C compiler that supports at least C11
- C++ compiler that supports at least C++20
- Python3 >= 3.9 with python3-venv installed
- Gcovr (optional)

1. Setup Protobufs for the version(s) of the library being built.  See [Protobufs](#protobufs).

2. See the `docs` directory for how to perform static analysis and code formatting. **You must set up Cppcheck and Uncrustify before configuring CMake.**

3. Configure CMake.

   `cmake -B build -G Ninja` or `cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCAVETALK_BUILD_TESTS=ON` to build with tests

4. Run the static analysis and code formatting tools.

   - Cppcheck: `cmake --build build -t cppcheck`
   - Uncrustify: `cmake --build build -t uncrustify`

5. Build the project.

   `cmake --build build`

6. If the project was configured to build tests, run the tests.

   `cmake --build build -t test`

7. If the project was configured to build tests and Gcovr is installed, generate a coverage report.  The coverage report can be found in the `build` directory at `coverage.html`. 

   `cmake --build build -t coverage-no-test` or `cmake --build build -t coverage` to run the tests and generate the coverage report in a single command
